  >Wrapper
  >Only happens when we deal with a wrapper class 
  -A wrapper is a object that shadows primitive datatype
  
  -Explain it deals with wrappers that have a 1-> relation with primitives
  -Is used for using primitives in generics
  -Also when you need to reffernce instead of value

**O()**{
  Categorize algorithms that have those values
  ```
  1
  log n
  n^2
  2^n
  ```
  and explain behavior when they grow by a factor of 10
  -Categorize means describe all 
  -1 is of no preformance conern, may have a buvg in logic, input makes no difference, may be charactorized of the wrong code
  -Logarithmatically looped, eachloop will reduce the number of required iterations during each iterations Run time may be n - logn but it is always less than n, all you can say is less than n and more than 1. 
  -nlogn is bewteen n^2 and log n
  -n^2 is quadratic, increases exponentially, often two nested loops although can show up without loops.
  -2^n is not usefull, runtime is far too long, not worth the time, just find a better alrgoithm
