Data is raw facts.
Information is parsed data and is more useful. 

Java has an API, reusable library of methods

Java and OO are lowering the cost of coding by reducing manpower and increasing reusability.
Java API code may not be optimized or custom, but it is cost effective. 
Sometimes using the standard system that is slower is better when optimization is not necessary. 

An interface is a way to use libraries of code 

public interface Foobar{
  public int doSomegthing(int x){}
  public boolean doSomethingElse(String x){}
}

Do not do things linearly 

Iterables and collections implement interfaces that allow you to be useful to many users.
