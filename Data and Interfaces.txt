Data is raw facts.
Information is parsed data, and is more useful. 

Java has a API, reuseable library of methods

Java and OO is lowering the cost of coding by reducing man power and increasing reusibility.
Java API code may not be optimized or custom, but it is cost affective. 
Sometimes using standard code that is slower is better when optimization is not necassary. 

An interface is a way to use libraries of code 

public interface Foobar{
  public int doSomegthing(int x){}
  public boolean doSomethingElse(String x){}
}

Do not do things linearly
